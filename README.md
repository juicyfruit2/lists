# lists

- Write a Python program called John.py that takes in a user’s input as a
string.
 -While the string is not “John”, add every string entered to a list until “John”
is entered. This program basically stores all incorrectly entered strings in a
list where “John” is the only correct string.
- Print out the list of incorrect names.
- Example program run (what should show up in the Python Console when
you run it):
- Enter your name : <user enters Tim>
- Enter your name : <user enters Mark>
- Enter your name: <user enters John>
- Incorrect names: [‘Tim’, ‘Mark’]
- HINT: When testing your While loop, you can make use of .upper() or
.lower() to eliminate case sensitivity.
